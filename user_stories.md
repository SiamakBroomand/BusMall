As a market analyst, I would like to have an app to be able to detect group's interest in potential products and gives me information about percentage and products chosen. To be able to manage my product line.

As a developer, I want to make a website or app to focus on three products at a time which are presented side-by-side, then store, calculate and visually display the resulting data of the most likely purchasing product to marketing analyst. I want my app to be interactive and interesting to user-face.

As audience, we want to see an easy and fast survey which is handy and brief to be able to spend time on it.
